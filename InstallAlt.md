## Install the Cursors Manually
1. Edit the `'rksra'` to your User Profile like `John`. Or take ` %USERPROFILE% ` or ` %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH% `
2. Run this _Install_Run-As-Admin_ as Admin. 
3. Then Press "Windows Key + R" and run this command `rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL main.cpl @0,1`
4. Select the `Busy` cursor and click on `Browse...` and select the `busy.ani`.
5. Like the (4.), do that all with manually.. I can't anything if Install.inf doesn't work. 

   (But select the main cursor, select any cursor like `Windows Black (system scheme)`)
6. And `Apply`.
