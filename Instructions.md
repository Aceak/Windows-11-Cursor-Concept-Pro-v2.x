 ## Install the Cursors Manually
1. Run this _Install_Run-As-Admin_ as Admin. 
2. Then Press "Windows Key + R" and run this command `rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL main.cpl @0,1`.
3. Select the `Busy` cursor and click on `Browse..` and select the `busy.ani`.
4. Select like the (4.), same goes to all .ani/.ico files.. you have to do that all manually.. I can't do much if Install.inf doesn't work. 
   > IMPORTANT NOTE: [But select the main cursor, select any cursor like "Windows Black (system scheme)"]
    
 5. And click on "Apply" and DONE!
